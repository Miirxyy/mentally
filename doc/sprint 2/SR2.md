This sprint we were able to successfully complete all our tasks. 

Looking back at how sprint 2 went we found that we performed much better this sprint as compared to our last sprint, sprint1. We improved our progress rate by breaking down what each member has to do earlier on in the sprint giving us ample amount of time to work on our specified tasks. We didn't really have any bad practices this sprint which was pretty good. We just need to keep up the organization and continue to update each other on things that are completed. 

Our best experience was the process of accepting pull requests to merge and being able to see all of our userstories come together into one app. There wasn't really a bad experience during sprint 2.
