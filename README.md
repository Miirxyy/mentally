1. On your first visit of MentAlly, you are required to create a user account by registering. You can register and create an account by clicking the “Don't have an account? Sign up here” link. If you are a returning user, you can simply log in to the app by entering your email and password.

2. After entering your information such as your name and email, you will then be directed to the profile page of the app. This is where you can view your information, and also make edits. You are also able to sign out of the app from the profile page by clicking the sign out button. 

3. You are able to navigate through the various modules/features of the app by clicking the three bars icon on the top left of the screen. By clicking this, the navigation menu pops up, allowing you to navigate to the feature you like. 

4. On the Home screen of MentAlly, a daily motivational quote is shown in order to stimulate and encourage the user. If you wish to change the wallpaper displayed on the Home screen, you can do so from the Change Wallpaper module. MentAlly provides various aesthetically pleasing wallpapers to comfort you and complement your style.

5. There is a ToDo feature in MentAlly which makes organizing tasks easier than before! You can add new tasks to your list and specify the starting date and the ending date if you wish. You are also able to mark tasks as completed so that you can be proud of the amount of work you finished! 

6. The HabitTracker is a great addition to the app where users are able to track their habits, and keep a record of how often they have been doing that habit. This helps to motivate users and keep them going! Users can also specify the ending date of a particular habit and the tracking frequency (Weekly, monthly etc).

7. Something our users find useful is the MoodTracker. This easy-to-use feature helps users keep a log of their past moods, which helps track progress or point out when the user requires assistance. 

8. A unique feature for MentAlly is the Breathe module. This module is a special one since it helps the user meditate and relax. The user can specify the breathing pattern they wish to follow, and the module will animate that particular exercise for the user. Along with the Breathe module, there is an Ambient Noises feature which plays soothing meditation music, further allowing the user to relax and rejuvenate. 

9. MentAlly understands that Mental health issues are serious, so it provides a series of questionnaires for various mental health conditions in the Self-Assess module. This is very useful since the user is able to get an idea of their well-being by simply answering a few questions. 

10. In the case that the user is in a state of stress and/or panic, there are several quick-to-access helplines given to the user. The user has an option to visit their website or call a particular helpline for a more private conversation.

11. We understand that in times of stress, family helps us out the most. That is why MentAlly has provided an Emergency contacts module where users can enter family members’ contacts and contact them in an emergency.

12. Last but not least, MentAlly has a Call Emergency Services feature where the user is able to call 911 if something has gone wrong, or they are in need of help urgently.
